       <strong>AutomationML (Automation Markup Language)</strong> is a neutral data format based on XML 
       for the storage and exchange of plant engineering information, 
       which is provided as open standard. Goal of AutomationML is to interconnect the 
       heterogeneous tool landscape of modern engineering tools in their different disciplines,
        e.g. mechanical plant engineering, electrical design, HMI development, PLC, robot control.

        <p><strong>OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)</strong> is an industrial M2M communication protocol for 
        interoperability developed by the OPC Foundation. It is the successor to 
        Open Platform Communications (OPC). Although developed by the same organization,
         OPC UA differs significantly from its predecessor. The Foundation's goal for this 
         project was to provide a path forward from the original OPC communications model 
         (namely the Microsoft Windows only process exchange COM/DCOM) to a cross-platform 
         service-oriented architecture (SOA) for process control, while enhancing security and providing an 
         information model.
    After more than three years of specification work and another year for a prototype implementation,
    the first version of the Unified Architecture was released in 2006.
